"As Yo Leeg, a hip-hop group that includes: Yo Aussie Rap, Yo Homie Boyy, Yo Playyr Tonii, Yo Boyy Drachtel, & Yo Sirr Donii (Note: After the passing of Yo Aussie Rap, Yo Best Duud joined Yo Leeg. Yo Best Duud is the son of the late Quanzo Feis (1975-2017 -- died of helicopter crash with Ro$$ Regaldi). Quanzo Feis was the manager of Yo Leeg, which was formed in 2013. The next manager was Yo Aussie Rap (1986-2020), then after Yo Aussie Rap died, the new and current manager is Andre$ Bferde (1991). Although Yo Boyy Drachtel was next in line, he, at the time, was in court being sued by Travis Geroy for destruction of property. The lawsuit was settled when security footage revealed that French rapper Lil Xyzz Ve had shot the window of Geroy's home, barely missing Geroy's bodyguard Benji Vargen. Xyzz Ve, born Xander de Zeuve, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for attemted murder."

The album, END, was praised by many (critic Quinlin Bausch, critic $la$h$ang$, etc) to be the third best album, following Dedicated 2 U by Lil Quezr (2nd place) and Gone, and Back by Suez Flam (1st). Also, the most popular song of the album, On Dope, which features Suez Flam, Mashding, Richz, & Iceii, charted at no. 5, following Volia (Mashding ft. $vii, Lil Rentr, & Yung Avid -- 4th), Hurts (Jeron ft.

"T8 (born Tate Mahoto on July 17, 1997), an American rapper, released his debut album, Tropic$, in 2017. It did surprisingly very well, peaking at number 2, earning him a signature at Voun later that year. He was unsigned in 2018 due to the fact that he was performing badly (as in only releasing 1 song for all of 2018, which was called 'Hit', which featured Michel Arudt, pondes donii, & QQ Jefreiy. The song was originally planning to feature Yung Avid, Yo Aussie Rap, & Yonsa, but due to financial issues the song almost didn't happen, but T8 felt it necessary to release it. The song was considered a flop, resulting in T8 being unsigned from the record label. In an interview, he said 'At least I released something in 2018. Better than nothing.' The song was not included in any album, mixtape, or ep). Even though he was unsigned he still managed to be popular to this day. Yo Aussie Rap was had actually considered a resigning before Yo Aussie Rap's fatal demise. During the period where T8 was unsigned, the two kept a good relation, with T8 saying in an interview, 'I was not performing to A-Grade material that I was signed to do. I can perfectly understand why I was unsigned. That really was a wake up call to me. No hard feelings.' He has released 1 album and 4 mixtapes, all of which have performed good:"

"First artist signed to Yo Aussie Rap's label Voun (Tsof) released album called 'Soft' two weeks ago. How does it stand up against the critics? | Febuary 4, 2013"
"After his success with his viral song 'Soft', Voun labelmate Tsof (born Tsof Daio) released his first album called Soft two weeks ago. Backed by support from big time rappers including Richz, Suez Flam, & Yo Aussie Rap, many thought the album would do well in. But, fans were disappointed when they realized that the only singles from the album were Soft, 5 remixes for Soft, and other boring singles. Also, the biggest artist that was featured on there was Jab the Yung, and he was only featured on one of the remixes of Soft. So, how do the critics like it?"
"Critic Kyle Uract says: 'Tsof leaves us waiting for more after his hit 'Soft', but all he delivers is 5 remixes and other songs. Of course, with a title like Soft, you can't not listen to the album. Personally, the only other song that stuck out to me was Aceboiz, featuring Yng Vybz. Maybe Hate em is ok. But the rest is junk. Not even Jab the Yung could make Soft better than it already is. Nobody could.'"
"Oliver Breau says: 'Nope. Not worth your time. You can tell he tried, but it wasn't enough. He wasted great talent and made an album that was supported by at most three tracks. Even the previously worst album (LeTaevraj's album Plaatr) sounded better. Tsof could've done better, but I think that he rushed his album. Let's hope that Yung Avid's rumored track D-day will help Tsof. What was it again, D-day by Yung Avid featuring Tsof, Laaun, & Xaaj?'"
"The only critic to have liked the album was Tayven Reus. He said: 'Tsof did very well on his new album Soft. I personally had no care for the main single Soft. My favorite single of the album is Hate em. Now, I know no one else liked his album, but I think my comment will save this album from a 0/5 score.'"
"The audiece rated this a 1/5 while the critcs gave it a .5/5. Later in another interview, TV host Barry Yerab asked Tsof on why his album didn't feature big artists. Tsof responded by saying:"
"'I didn't feature big names like Richz or Suez because I want to save that for later. I mean, I have a whole career ahead of me, and I don't want to get it all done in one big swoop like Vihra L. Remember him? Yeah, wasn't he from the early 2000's? I believe he just featured all of the big artists in the beginning of his career, then ran out of ideas for songs. I believe his latest song was released 9 months ago, and it featured Quai Beh Nii, Mawra, & Yy$$. See, is that what I want to turn into? No I don't. Suez Flam started out with little to no features on his projects. Until 1987, his biggest feature was on his 1986 track 'Side wit tha bosses', which featured Lrasc & Hitme2thatop. From his career beginnings in 1978 to 1987, he had a total feature count of 5, them being the two previously mentioned, Mr. Ronald Weslon, Billy North, & JYoung. The rest were solo singles. Yes, the biggest rapper of all time started out with a mere handful of features from unheard of artists and he still made it to be the greatest.'"
"After his statement about Vihra L, Vihra L released a diss track called 'The fall of Tsof', and it featured Attr & Derqk Hvna. The beginning goes like 'Boy, I've just gotten started.' He later goes on to say that Tsof is going to end his career here pretty soon."
"This is Dexter Viktorsson, bringing you the hottest new hip hop."

"After his failure of his album 'Soft', Voun signee Tsof retires. | July 9, 2013"
"Looks like Vihra L was correct that Tsof was gonna fail. After 2 unsucessful guest appearances, Tsof feels that this isn't working out for him. It was rumored that a new song was going to appear, it is said to be with Suez Flam & Richz (most likely Suez's song). The rumor seems to have been debunked. *edit on September 17, 2013: The song that was rumored that Tsof, Richz, & Suez Flam is out now. It's called Roll out, and its Suez Flam ft. Yo Leeg & Richz.* Too bad Tsof has to end his career."

"Rapper TnT Nehro has been murdered at 20. | August 28, 2018"
"Rapper TnT Nehro (born Vladimar Nero Azetrohrskiev) has been murdered at the age of 20 by fellow rappers Lil Yghoff and Lil Duhngy. Police say that Nehro was killed due to issues with money. Lil Yghoff says that he and Duhngy killed Nehro because Nehro was making to much money. He also claims that TnT Nehro had not paid all his taxes."
"Officer Muren Michevonov theorizes that the reason TnT Nehro was murdered was because of the two Yung Avid collaborations, which really boosted Nehro's fame. His single with Yung Avid, called Seats, featuring Harold Grahnis & Richz, debuted at no. 1 on the Russian charts and at no. 2 on the British charts (it lost to Suez Flam's Now U Know, featuring Janson Tricr, Suynf, & Peebody Frenk.) The song eventually made it to no. 1 worldwide, making it Nehro's highest charting song and Yung Avid's 3rd time completing the feat. (Yung Avid's first no. 1 that topped the international charts was his 2010 single 'Updown bussin'. A remix came featuring Jab the Yung, Mashding, & Elasiou. The second single to make the feat was the remix to his 2014 critically-acclaimed single 'Leaders', which the remix featured Suez Flam, Yo Leeg, Guese, & Wrehdafi)"
"Lil Duhngy stated that while TnT Nehro was getting famous, the final straw was when TnT Nehro said he was working with Yung Avid on 2 songs, and one of them was going to feature 2 artists. Yghoff & Duhngy, being fans of Yung Avid, hoped that Nehro would choose them. He later came out and said that he chose unheard-of rock singer Harold Grahnis & famous rapper Richz. Furious, the two started planning when the murder was going to happen."
"So, on August 27, 2018, Duhngy & Yghoff started shooting at a restaurant, resulting in 3 deaths. 6 were injured, and, as of August 28, only one has died from injuries. The people who died on the scene were: TnT Nehro, rapper; Ivan Vyrepi, customer; & Tareq Neavio, waiter. The people who were injured were: Igor Klavensiy, owner; Mikhail Popov, customer; Jake Chang, customer; Rudolf Yerb, customer; & Egor Smirnoff, street musician (was the one who died)." 
"Yghoff & Duhngy fleed, but were shortly caught by the police. They are awaiting their trial."
